# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is a compatibility-based friend matching application.

This full-stack site takes in results from a user filled survey and compare them to the answers of other users.

The site includes a "friends" basic API.

## What I used

This full-stack site was built using HTML5, CSS3, [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/), JavaScript, jQuery, [SweetAlerts](https://sweetalert.js.org/) library, [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (for routing).
